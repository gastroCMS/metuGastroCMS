This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Local Admin Account (Development Only)

For testing the admin panel at `/admin`, a default admin user is seeded locally.

- Email: `admin@lezzetkesif.com`
- Password: `Admin123!ChangeMe`

Notes:

- Seed data and the admin account are inserted by `supabase/seed.sql` and migration `002_admin_user_setup.sql`.
- The admin role is tracked via the `public.admins` table and linked automatically by a trigger when the user is created.
- Do not use these credentials in production. Remove or change the password before deployment.

### Reset local database and reseed

```bash
supabase stop
supabase db reset  # drops, recreates, applies migrations, and seeds
supabase start
```
